Another small Angular hobby project. I approached the design with a mobile-first mindset to create a responsive website 
that looks good on all screen sizes.
I also made a neat generic component for an animated accordion.

The content of the page is some world-building info about a PnP RPG Campaign I'm running. 

Thanks to AngularClass for providing the seed repo
